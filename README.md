# Histopathology Image Retrieval Project-MA

![Histopathology Image Retrieval]

Welcome to the Histopathology Image Retrieval project! This repository contains code and resources for implementing a deep learning model to perform histopathology image retrieval. The goal of this project is to develop a robust system that can retrieve relevant histopathology images based on user queries. Convolutional models, along with attention mechanisms, are employed to achieve accurate and meaningful image retrieval.

**Note:** This project is based on the research presented in the paper, "A Deep Metric Learning Approach for Histopathological Image Retrieval."

## Project Description

In the Histopathology Image Retrieval project, we tackle the task of retrieving histopathology images based on user-defined queries. Histopathology images play a crucial role in medical diagnosis and research, and efficient retrieval of relevant images can aid in accurate diagnosis and analysis. To achieve this, we have implemented a deep learning model that leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms. By combining these techniques, we aim to capture both local and global features within the images, enhancing the retrieval accuracy.

## Dataset

This project utilizes the following datasets:

1. **BRACS Dataset**
   - Website: [BRACS Dataset](https://www.bracs.icar.cnr.it/)
   - Description: The BRACS dataset contains a collection of histopathology images for various tissue types. It serves as a valuable resource for training and evaluating our image retrieval model.

2. **CRC Dataset**
   - Website: [CRC Dataset](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/tia/data/extended_crc_grading/)
   - Description: The CRC dataset offers histopathology images related to colorectal cancer. These images contribute to the diversity of the training data and aid in building a robust retrieval system.

3. **BATCH Dataset**
   - Website: [BATCH Dataset](https://iciar2018-challenge.grand-challenge.org/Dataset/)
   - Description: The BATCH dataset is a part of the ICAR 2018 challenge and consists of histopathology images for various tasks. It provides an additional set of images for validating and testing our retrieval model.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
```   
git clone https://github.com/your-username/histopathology-retrieval.git
cd histopathology-retrieval
```


## Usage

Follow these steps to run the histopathology image retrieval model:

1. Preprocess the datasets: Implement preprocessing scripts to prepare the datasets for training and evaluation.

2. Train the model: Run training scripts to train the deep learning model using the prepared datasets.

3. Evaluate the model: Use evaluation scripts to assess the performance of the model on the validation and test datasets.

4. Run retrieval: Implement retrieval scripts that take user queries as input and retrieve relevant histopathology images.

## Model Architecture

Our retrieval model is built upon convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms. The CNNs serve as feature extractors, capturing hierarchical features from input images. The attention mechanisms enhance the model's ability to focus on relevant image regions during retrieval.
